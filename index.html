        <h1>AudioLDM: Text-to-Audio Generation with Latent Diffusion Models</h1>
        <p>Text-to-audio (TTA) has recently gained attention from researchers for its ability to generate general sounds based on text descriptions. Recent studies in TTA have limited generation quality with high computational costs. In this study, we propose AudioLDM, a TTA system that is built on a latent space to learn the continuous audio representations from contrastive language-audio pertaining (CLAP) latents. Our system is self-conditioned during training and focuses on modeling the distribution of audio signals and their compositions. The pretrained CLAP models enable us to train LDMs with audio embedding while providing text embedding as a condition during sampling. By learning TTA without modeling the cross-modal relationship, AudioLDM is advantageous in both generation quality and computational efficiency. Trained on AudioCaps with a single GPU, AudioLDM achieves state-of-the-art TTA performance measured by both objective and subjective metrics with fewer parameters. Moreover, AudioLDM is the first TTA system that enables various text-guided audio manipulations (e.g., style transfer) in a zero-shot fashion. Our implementation and demos are publicly available.</p>
